# M200Diagnostics
This is a low-level hardware diagnostic firmware for the M200 class printers such as the Malyan M200 or Monoprice Mini.
It allows access to the hardware at a low level for testing of fans, heaters, thermistors, steppers, endstops, LCDs,
and SD cards.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Heaters do not remain on now, because I don't trust people.

DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FIRMWARE TO GO BACK TO.

While I have tested it on V1 and early V2s, I haven't tried it on later run V2s or deltas.

To use this: Flash onto the printer and connect via your favorite terminal.
The menus should be largely self-explanatory.
